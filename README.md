Code description
CODE-1.1: It is used to calculate the annual changes in various climate variables in 1pctCO2, 1pctCO2-rad and 1pctCO2-bgc simulation experiments, including precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, net radiation and wind speed.
CODE-1.2: It is used to calculate the annual changes in various climate variables caused by the interaction (INT) between CO2 radiative (RAD) and physiological forcing (BGC).
CODE-2: It is used to calculate the monthly time series of each climate variable during 106–135th years, excluding the effects of RAD, BGC, and INT. 
CODE-3: It used an improved version of the FAO-56 PM formula to calculate PET in 1pctCO2 control experiment.
CODE-4: It is used to calculate PET in sensitivity experiments, where CODE-4.1 to 4.5 are CO2 experiment, temperature experiments, relative humidity experiments, net radiation experiments and wind speed experiments, respectively.
CODE-5: Calculate the contributions of RAD-, BGC-, and INT-induced climate variables’ changes to future annual PET changes based on the joint-solution method that includes multiple sensitivity experiments.
CODE-6: It is used to calculate SPEI3 in all experiments, including control experiment and sensitivity experiments, and the parameters of the control experiment are used to fit the sensitivity experiments.
CODE-7: Calculate the contributions of RAD-, BGC-, and INT-induced climate variables’ changes to future annual SPEI3 changes based on the joint-solution method that includes multiple sensitivity experiments.
